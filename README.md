# Hi, welcom to my personal introduction.
My name is Ava, my favoret culture is Japanies. I finde their customs and traditions are very interesting to me.
Two historical figures I relate to is Yan Liben. He shows emotions from his art style and I love drawing to express myself. the second person I relate to is Anna Pavlova. She was a ballet dancer and was known as small and thin frame. I was in dance and took ballet and I was the smallest one in dance, I liked it since i could express myself through it.
A meal I like is spagety, my dad makes the best homemade sauce from his garden. I dont have one that represents me.
I feel most creative when I draw and dance
